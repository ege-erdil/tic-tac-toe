# tic-tac-toe
A value learning agent that learns how to play Tic Tac Toe.

The script will train the agent when you run it for the first time. After that, you can use the trained agent to play the game by initializing playState to an empty instance of the TicTacToe class, then calling playerMove(move) to input your own moves and computerMove() to ask the computer to play a move. You can also have the computer play against itself by repeatedly calling computerMove().
